David Farrow is an American sound artist, researcher, and ethnomusicologist based in New York City. Farrow's artistic work employs noise, synthesis, and field recordings to explore how sound and listening practices construct political space. They are completing their PhD in Ethnomusicology at Columbia University examining the limits of do-it-yourself music scenes' cultural and economic autonomy within capitalist urban development. Farrow's writing has appeared in Current Musicology, Tiny Mix Tapes, and within zines published by evil dentist. They have delivered presentations on their research at Harvard University, Columbia University, Northwestern University, Georgetown University, and New York University. Farrow's audio/visual installation work has been exhibited at the University of London. They regularly perform experimental electronic music as “certain lives” within New York’s experimental, rave, and independent music scenes.
