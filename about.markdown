I am a researcher, noise musician, and poet. My research examines the political economy of do-
it-yourself music. I am interested in how the progressive and collectivist ethics of do-it-yourself gets folded into the schemes of city planners and real estate developers. I study the tension within my scene of experimental electronic music where trans and queer people find a space for community and self-expression even as this scene is harnessed to facilitate rising rents and racial displacement. My writing has been published in Current Musicology, Tiny Mix Tapes, my blog certainlives.com, and various self-made zines. My research is interwoven with my performance practice. I organize experimental music and performance in venues, basements, apartments, parks, offices, galleries, moss gardens, bridges, scenic overlooks, and rooftops. Sometimes people dance, sometimes people stand still. Sometimes the music is abrasive, sometimes it’s groovy. My performances fold noise into erratic movements, atmospheric reflections, and screamed personal confessions. My poetry reflects on immediacy and intimacy. As an instructor, I have taught at Columbia University, New York University, and the North Carolina Governor’s School. Through courses on experimental music, communication, and philosophy, I have developed practice-based pedagogies that teach encourage students to develop their ideas through art, personal reflection, and social practice. In my free time, I paint, meditate, and grow my collection of clowns.
