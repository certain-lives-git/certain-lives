Our eight hour drives compressing the route between Chicago and Portland into four days. Do-It-Yourself touring enfolded our ambition and naivete. We were unfettered sound, bouncing between houses, basements, lofts, and venues, hoping to cover the west coast and to drive back to New York City in rapid time. </span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c2">DIY touring is more about relationships than music. Who&rsquo;s couch you sleep on, who lets you play music in their home, how you get paid, who performs with you, who listens to your road stories, and who rolls their eyes at your stupid decisions&ndash;we were enmeshed in a network of ears, eyes, hands, voices, sweat, and sound. A network actualizing desire. </span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c2">Finally, the signal stabilized. Zev, the director of the experimental music non-profit ISSUE Project Room, had wanted to chat with us about our first program as the 2023 Suzanne Foil Curatorial Fellows. My research and performance project with Alice, evil dentist, had been selected to curate three shows throughout the year. Vibrating with the chaos of our tour, we chattered with Zev about our vision of &ldquo;The Corporate Retreat,&rdquo; a series of performances within underutilized office spaces throughout New York City. We felt performance could question the role artists should play in shaping real estate usage following the reorganization of offices and retail spaces in response to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Somewhere between our dreams and the word &ldquo;durational&rdquo;, Zev quipped, &ldquo;DIY desires must meet institutional needs.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Desire is expansive, filling a map of the country.

My desire is for a way of life. </span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c2">Can DIY desires&ndash;those found within the chaotic expanse of our tour&ndash;be circumscribed within art institutions?

The role of artists&ndash;both within and outside of institutions&ndash;is in question. We are called to rebuild our cities (or to gentrify them); we are asked to question authority (but not too much lest the donors get upset); we are encouraged to build community (within the confines of the gallery or concert hall).

We began with the belief that criticizing corporate real estate interests, the New York City government, and the distribution of resources for living and producing art is best achieved through building alternative social, political, and artistic structures. The Corporate Retreat was an attempt to think inside and against art institutions to sketch a creative life.

Posture assumed at a desk, the phone waiting to be picked up, water cooler chat only a momentary reprieve from the discipline of work. How do we disrupt how a space can be used? Walkouts, slowdowns, and strikes all transform the mundane workplace into a political arena. The underlying conflict between workers and owners is laid bare through a refusal to continue acting as one is supposed within the workplace. </span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c6 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">Our first program with ISSUE, &ldquo;A Night at the Office&rdquo;, used performance to disrupt what an office space could be. Staged in an underutilized office space at New York University, the night paired performances by FRANK/ie Consent and Kate Mohanty with a sound installation. We sought to render the banality of the office uncanny. In the context of abundant open office space, we dreamed what the City would be like if the floors of empty offices were filled with performance.

Performance gestures towards an unrealized future while living within the absent present of our desires. Our little utopia was the office space, overrun by ravers, punks, and artists, scheming worlds to build within the ache of their absence. </span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c6 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">As everyone arrived at the office, we ceremoniously &ldquo;hired&rdquo; each audience member, all while demanding they sign an &ldquo;evil dentist employment contract&rdquo;. This gave us the authority to boss everyone around, order them to go from performance to performance over the three hour duration, demand they answer the phones&ndash;a sound installation piece recording and playing back conversations between paired phone lines&ndash;and mingle in the conference room. As time progressed, our workers started to ask more of us, eventually unionizing and presenting a list of demands. </span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c6 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c2">Disrupting the office meant demonstrating that a community can form regardless of the predetermined use for a space. We wanted to dream what would happen if collectives appropriated Midtown office space, drafting their own plans for what could bloom on each floor. </span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c6 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c7">But this indulgence in utopianism only made apparent the limits of our vision. As curators and artists, we engaged with the office as an aesthetic. We substituted aesthetic subversion for political engagement. We hosted a temporary reinvention of the space, but failed to commit to the difficult work of holding space for political, artistic, and social experimentation.
