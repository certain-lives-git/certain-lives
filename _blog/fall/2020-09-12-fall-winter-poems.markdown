a collection of poems written from fall-winter 2024
<br>
<br>
who are they the children of? <br> 
<br> 
<br> 
My absence of discipline <br>
Reflects <br> 
My difficulties with self-love. <br>
I need to recontextualize discipline <br>
as an act of self-love. <br>
<br> 
Modulation <br>
<br>
Appreciation. A discipline of self-love. <br>
<br>
<br>
a candle at the vigil <br> 
<br>
Hear the ringing <br>
in your ears <br>
as the grief <br>
of the world. <br>
<br>
Feel the string <br>
of autumn <br>
air <br> 
<br>
Everything moves <br>
at its <br>
proper <br>
pace. <br> 
<br>
<br> 
Kicking Glass <br>
<br>
Bloom Stains <br>
Dog Hair <br>
Cream Tile <br>
Caked Dirt <br>
Onion Peel <br>
Walk Walk <br>
Cover Toe <br>
BLood Stains <br>
Paper Towel <br> 
Foot Steps <br> 
Black Plastic <br>
Trash Bag <br>
Walk Back <br>
Drop Hay <br>
Fumble <br> 
<br>
<br> 
A prayer for headphones <br>
<br>
May I walk down the street <br>
Ensconsced in sound <br>
So I may hear <br>
My own thoughts <br>
My own taste <br>
My own love with the world <br>
I have created for myself <br>
<br>
May I ignore my neighbor <br>
Put plastic, rubber, and foam <br>
Between the conversation <br>
The interaction <br>
The exchange <br>
On my way out the door <br> 
<br>
<br>
Nowadays <br>
<br>
Sitting on the wooden platform <br>
I hear a voice in my head <br> 
the one that finds <br>
in each movement <br>
an affirmation <br>
love <br>
for <br>
myself <br>
I think about the cycle of breath and self, that each momement I breathe in, I bring into being my self. <br>
"That's waht its for," a dancer remarks, <br>
as if mocking my need <br>
to put into words <br>
what can be expressed in movement. <br>
A trickster trans girl <br>
mocking in that way that good clowns do, <br>
where you find what's already known. <br>
<br>
And maybe I feel the pull of someone <br>
who feels in a similar way to me. <br>
I feel clumsy and excited, the giddy <br>
of knowing I might slip. <br>
And how far to fall <br>
between becoming a girl <br>
falling in love <br>
or falling in love <br>
with myself <br>
as a girl <br>
in love. <br>
<br>
Not to get <br>
Too caught <br>
Crushed <br>
But to feel <br>
Like the sidewalks <br>
Stumbled between <br>
Writhing bodies <br>
At the electric distance <br>
Where I am far enough <br>
To lose the space <br>
Between our feet. <br>
Laugh, Trip, Stumble <br>
<br>
<br>
Drunk <br>
<br>
Jade Refracts <br> 
Kisses fall <br> 
Uncovered sleave <br>
Dance once a week <br>
What if I want to fuck you <br>
And figure out our connection later <br>
I'd dream <br>
In nights spent <br>
Dancing <br>
Losing myself <br>
In your breadth <br>
<br>
Drunk on the B Train <br> 
Crushing Orange Line Beers <br>
Grand Street Bound <br>
Too Slutty <br>
Too Smart <br>
My words caught in my mouth <br>
Fell asleep <br>
So long ago <br>
Erica on the train <br>
My concrete brain <br>
Everyone at Columbia <br>
Looks at me <br>
Like I'm a faggot <br>
They must be 
So Smart <br>
To Notice. <br>
<br>
My biggest flaw <br>
Is that I don't <br>
See <br>
My own <br>
Beauty <br>
<br>
Drunk on the B train <br>
Writing poetry to find <br>
The rush of my glance <br>
Meeting yours <br>
<br>
Drunk on the B train <br>
I refuse to leave <br>
I kick my feet up <br>
Spit My Beer <br>
Fuck You <br>
I am a faggot <br>
Fucking women <br>
Fucking men <br> 
I'm the shallow pool of spit <br>
We bathe in <br>
We breathe in <br>
<br>
<br> 
Pull-ups <br>
On the railing <br>
The J train rattles by <br>
Yawning autumn <br>
Against the Williamsburg high rise <br>
Nourish the cramped kitchen <br>
Let the smoke flow <br>
From the haunted toaster <br>
Spitting flames <br>
Half past <br>
My forgetful face <br>
Pressed against the grimy scene <br>
Bike by <br>
Stop <br>
But turn around <br> 
<br>
<br>
Your Polaroid <br>
<br>
A photo of us <br> 
From an Ashville bar <br>
Fell out from my journal <br>
I hadn't noticed it <br>
Tucked between the unwritten pages <br>
Long past my structured notes <br>
About why we couldn't be together <br>
But I remember wanting nothing more <br>
Than moments alone in the booth <br>
Than the timer ticking toward flash <br>
Then the press of your lips as the shuttered closed <br>
On a photo of us <br> 
<br> 
<br> 
A mouse <br>
curled up <br>
on my kitchen floor <br>
writhing <br>
almost like a dog <br>
rolling on his back <br>
almost, but not. <br>
The pained spasms <br>
of an unsure foot <br>
and me <br>
with a broom <br>
trying to help him outside <br>
or at least <br>
remove him <br>
from my sight <br>
compassion <br>
or my selfish desire <br>
to let live <br>
what will die <br>
<br>
<br>
A score for four ppl <br>
1) Think of your name <br>
2) Now think of another name <br>
3) Discard the first and second for a third. <br>
4) Introduce yourself <br>
5) Take your partners name. <br>
6) Go through your day with a new name. <br> 
<br>
<br>
scratch, jest, ride, drink, advance <br>
<br>
This is of a place, spiraling through the circuit party at market, maybe too many drinks and joints along the east river <br>
<br>
This is the movement in and out of the ID card to track my movement in and out of campus <br>
<br>
This is the cash register being chased, the pursuit of some things or experiences that might make me feel like I'm moving <br>
<br>
And I am caught in the movement of modulation, cycles, pusling tangled webs, root systems stretching underground, relations and relationships, vibrations and ethics, qualia, sense and sensation, the interwoven web of things that maybe in the last instance cohere into a structure-in-totality. <br>
<br>
I do not have the language of freedom. <br>
<br>
<br> 
How do you hear a place? <br>
Take out a sheet of paper <br>
close your eyes <br>
select a place that matters to you <br>
try to focus on the sounds of the place <br>
Can you hear them? <br>
Where does the sound exist? <br>
Pan <br>
Echo <br>
<br>
<br>
Dancing, an image <br>
<br>
The carpet gave too much <br>
with my step <br>
not quite finding <br>
the rhythm <br>
of interlacing hands <br>
of jumps and crashes <br>
"i thought about dancing with you" <br>
what a terrible thought <br>
to betray in hushed confidence <br>
after your friends passed the bottle that smelled of biting and pins <br>
i took your hands <br>
that drifted through the air <br>
like a ribbon, twirling and unfurling <br> 
set free into a ruin of thread <br>
Unearthed, Unearned Confidence <br>
<br>
<br>
There's something funny <br>
To seeing your ex <br>
In other people. <br>
At first, <br>
The Fear <br>
of an unplanned encounter <br>
of a flood of emotions <br>
from hands gliding through a mullet <br>
from plucking the matrix hat off to find their face <br>
the fading ache <br>
of nights grasping each other's form <br>
of finding the momentary embrace of a bathroom stall <br>
a handheld walk home <br>
among the snowflake shadows <br> 
But now, <br>
the resignation <br>
of dyed haircuts stretching down into braids <br>
of electronics recycled into sigils, wrought iron, and moss <br> 
from the fumbled assemblage of self <br>
From youth becoming a whisper of presence <br>
Among the faces in the crowd <br> 
<br>
<br>
"Mansions" <br> 
There was a moment of truth <br> 
In the afterglow of spurned affection <br> 
"Don't try to make it work <br>
If its not your end goal" <br>
Children of divorce, drinking and dancing <br>
In the after glow <br>
<br> 
<br> 
Liminal notes <br>
lost between <br>
the devil and the cloud <br>
a pretzel and a carrot <br>
my classroom or my desk. <br>
<br>
Before Sunset, <br>
a name escapes <br>
falling asleep <br>
on the benadryl periphery. <br>
<br>
I'd walk in the cold <br>
I'd bike in the snow <br>
I'd sweat in the greyhound <br>
my skin <br>
pricked by frost <br>
wet by snow <br>
sticky by seats <br>
all to curl up <br>
in the space <br>
in between. <br>
<br>
