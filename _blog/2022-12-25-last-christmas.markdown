last christmas
before our
divorced sorority christianity between triffles and the holiday after i lost my license
still don’t have a credit card
we fell asleep
in my
absent grandparents’
twin bed
why do you make me feel like it was a mistake to love you? when you snapped
about the return date
i left unspecified.
a year later
carving holiday designs into my damaged sexuality publicly
on the northeast corridor
i closed the door.
tofurky daze
mom needs space
dad’s from outer space
emotional management left me with the bill principle debt:
fascist fiancés
hollywood dreams
cleaning cost for piss-stained floors hugging pillows under gnawing green snow shaped dollar slices
thirty dollar tickets to half-baked ambition.
now i need to pay.
last christmas last thanksgiving last holiday
i think i
need
some
space
