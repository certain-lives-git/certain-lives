What must eric adams be thinking? the feds seized his phone. The standard corruption now receives higher scrutiny. No one in new york is surprised by a crooked cop. I feel like celebrating his downfall. Look what they've done to my beautiful boy! And what better way than w/ Francis Ford Coppola's <i>Megalopolis</i><br>
<br>
The old man has lost it. He sold off the vineyard; he's widely derided as a creep (but, as wild card mayorial candidate andrew cuomo will tell you, he's just being italian); he either used AI or fabricated negative quotes from critics himself; he wanted eitehr a live actor or an interactive ai to burst into each theater; he's set for a disasterous opening weekend. The megalopolis lore can go on and on and on. <br>
<br>
But, maybe like adams, coppola is a man out of step with time. A provacateur clinging to a way of transgression that no longer exists, like adams craving the corrupt mayorial lifestyle. <br>

I don't think megalopolis was good enough or bad enough. It lingers, like a pervy old man, trading in women. <br>

The central conflict between Caesar and Mayor Cicero is shallow. Should we let things be terrible like they are now or should we work together to make things better? For all his musings on time and consciousness, I'm not sure Coppola has more than an interconnected psychobabble. Am I for one love psychobabble, but his doesn't feel lived in. Caesar is design, a revolutionary break, but not so much taht family structure or the institution of marriage would be uprooted. In fact, the film is predicated on the trafficking of women. Wow from Caesar to Cassius; Julia from Cicero to Caesar. <br>
<br>
Julia's characterization is particularly flat, morphing from party girl to muse/therapist. Wow, delishishly played by aubrey plaza, climb
