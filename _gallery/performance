drip performance 

drip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6wPG3_7fDc  This clip is an  excerpt of a  6 hour long performance consisting of adding water strips of fabric to a chain link fence sculpture suspended over a micâ€™d piece of sheet metal. Over the course of the 6 hours, the sound of the water dripping on the metal plate would be modulated to create an increasingly delayed audio effect. The performance concluded with me pouring water over my head and letting the water drip from my hair onto the amplified sheet metal. This clip captures a moment of adding a piece of wet fabric to the sculpture, viewers can hear the sound of the amplified drip in the background. Performed in February 2024.
